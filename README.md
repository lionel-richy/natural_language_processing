 creating a word cloud. A word cloud is a snapshot of a text meant to help you explore it at a glance. It is a word image where each word's size is proportional to its importance (more frequent words appear larger). A word cloud can be particularly useful during a presentation to help engage your audience and draw attention to the main themes!
